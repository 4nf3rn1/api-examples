# Creating New Items

This example will demonstrate how to create custom Items.

Before we get started, ensure you change to the 03-creating-new-items directory.

## Configure

Insure you provide your credentials and Project ID within the `create.php` script.

## Dependencies

This example uses several dependencies to handle common tasks, such as making HTTP requests and working with UUIDs,
and also uses Composer to manage these dependencies.

Install these dependencies with Composer by running:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Run Example

To run the example:

```bash
$ php create.php
```

The example will create the new Item within your Project.
