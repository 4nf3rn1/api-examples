# Exporting to CSV

Within this example, we will demonstrate how to export Items to a CSV file.

Before we get started, ensure you change to the 02-exporting-to-csv directory.

## Configure

Insure you provide your credentials and Project ID within the `export.php` script.

## Dependencies

This example uses several dependencies to handle common tasks, such as making HTTP requests and working with CSV files,
and also uses Composer to manage these dependencies.

Install these dependencies with Composer by running:

```bash
$ composer install
```

## Run Example

To run the example:

```bash
$ php export.php
```

The example will create the `content.csv` file.
